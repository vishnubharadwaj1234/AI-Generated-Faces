# AI-Generated-Faces

This is a project I did to classify images of faces as real or AI generated.

You can find the link to the project on Google Drive here:

Next steps:
- Train a Vision Transformer model and assess it. See if it does better than VGG19
- Once TensorFlow or Keras has a model for Mamba, see if Mamba can do etter than Vision Transformer and VGG19
- Publish a research paper on this project
- Submit this project into a science fair
