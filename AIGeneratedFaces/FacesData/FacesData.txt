The ZIP files which contain the images of real faces and fake faces are too large to download on GitHub. 
Below are the links to the ZIP files on Google Drive where you can download them.

Real faces: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nEBwjzT9-BRV79jrIHwWAcvMi2M9DX4V/view?usp=sharing
Fake faces: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8EggBGc0tuoeJfGTfSTUuHV0YBGD9or/view?usp=sharing

Note that when you download these ZIP files and you want to run the notebook, the files will need to be in the FacesData folder.
